        "\n",
        "*   **Linear Separability:** A Perceptron can only classify linearly separable data. This means if you can draw a single straight line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) to separate the different classes, a Perceptron can learn it.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **XOR's Non-Linear Nature:** The XOR function is not linearly separable. If you plot the inputs `(0,0)`, `(0,1)`, `(1,0)`, `(1,1)` and their corresponding outputs, you'll find that `(0,0)` and `(1,1)` are one class (0), and `(0,1)` and `(1,0)` are another class (1). No single straight line can separate these two groups of points.\n",
        "\n",
        "    *   For example, consider a 2D plane: points (0,0) and (1,1) have output 0, while (0,1) and (1,0) have output 1. Any line you draw will incorrectly classify at least one point.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Solution:** To solve non-linearly separable problems like XOR, a single-layer Perceptron is insufficient. You need a more complex architecture, such as a **multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)**, also known as a feedforward neural network with at least one hidden layer. Hidden layers allow the network to learn non-linear decision boundaries by transforming the input data into a new feature space where it becomes linearly separable."
